# Movie Box Office Gross Prediction using IBM Watson Machine Learning

# Proposed Solution:

This is a classic example of supervised learning. We have been provided with a fixed
number of features for each data point, and our aim will be to train a variety of Supervised
Learning algorithms on this data, so that when a new data point arises, our best
performing classifier can be used to categorize the data point as a positive example or
negative. Exact details of the number and types of algorithms used for training is included
in the 'Algorithms and Techniques' sub-section of the 'Analysis' part. This project focuses
on the related works of various movies to calculate box office gross prediction such that
algorithms were implemented using Jupyter that is a machine learning software written in
Python. Various attributes that are essential in the prediction of movie gross were
examined and the dataset of movies were also evaluated. This project compares various
classification algorithms such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and KNN
classification Algorithm with an aim to identify the best technique. Based on this study,
Random Forest with the highest accuracy outperformed the other algorithms and can be
further utilized in the prediction of movie box office gross recommended to the user. Later
by using Flask app create html files and create a user interface to display the movie box
office gross prediction values.
